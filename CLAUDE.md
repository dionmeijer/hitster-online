# CLAUDE.md — Hitster Online

This file is read by Claude Code at the start of every session. Read it fully before touching any code.

## Key documents — read these before writing code

| Document | When to read |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` (this file) | Every session — rules and constraints |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Before adding or changing any server/client module |
| `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` | Before implementing any game feature |
| `shared/types.ts` | Before defining new event shapes or state fields |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Step-by-step guide for adding features, tests, and events |

## What this project is

A browser-based multiplayer implementation of the **Hitster** card game. Players build a chronological timeline of songs by listening to 30-second audio previews and guessing whether each song belongs before or after the ones already on their timeline. First to correctly place 6 cards wins.

The full functional requirements, architecture, and game rules are in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`. Read that file if you need detail on game mechanics.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Drag & drop | @dnd-kit/core (timeline card placement) |
| Real-time | Socket.io v4 (client + server) |
| Backend | Node.js + TypeScript, Express |
| External API | Spotify Web API (Client Credentials Flow) |
| State | In-memory only — no database |
| Hosting | Fly.io (see `docs/DEPLOY_FLY.md`; `railway.toml` optional) |

## How to run locally

```bash
# Install all dependencies
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install

# Set environment variables (create server/.env)
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
PORT=3000

# Run server (from /server)
npm run dev

# Run client (from /client, in a separate terminal)
npm run dev

# To simulate multiplayer: open multiple browser tabs at http://localhost:5173
```

## Architecture rules — read before writing code

### 1. Game state lives on the server only
All game logic (turn order, placement validation, token accounting, win detection) runs in `server/src/game/`. Clients are dumb renderers — they display what the server tells them. **Never put game logic in the client.**

### 2. Define types before writing logic
Before adding a new feature or event, define its TypeScript type in `shared/types.ts`. Both server and client import from there. This prevents event shape mismatches.

### 3. Socket.io event naming convention
All events use `domain:action` format:

```
room:created        room:joined         room:updated
round:started       round:ended
turn:started        turn:placed         turn:flipped       turn:challenged
player:joined       player:left
error:*
```

Server emits to rooms using `io.to(roomCode).emit(...)`. Never emit to individual sockets for game events.

### 4. No database
State is a `Map<string, Room>` held in memory. Do not introduce a database, Redis, or any persistence layer. Rooms are lost on server restart — this is acceptable.

### 5. No user authentication
Players are identified by a `sessionId` (UUID generated client-side on first visit, stored in `sessionStorage`). No login, no JWT, no cookies. The room owner is simply the player whose `sessionId` created the room.

### 6. Spotify integration
- Use **Client Credentials Flow** only. Never use Authorization Code Flow.
- The token is fetched server-side and refreshed automatically before expiry.
- Fetch preview URLs from `track.preview_url` on the Spotify track object.
- Tracks with `preview_url === null` must be flagged — do not silently include them in the deck.
- Never expose `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` or `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` to the client.

### 7. Audio playback sync
When a turn starts, the server emits:
```ts
{ event: 'turn:started', previewUrl: string, playAt: number } // playAt = Date.now() + 600
```
Each client uses `setTimeout` to start `<audio>.play()` at exactly `playAt`. Do not stream audio from the server.

## Game mechanics cheat sheet

| Mechanic | Rule |
|---|---|
| Starting cards | Each player/team gets 1 card face-up to anchor their timeline |
| First turn | Player/team with the oldest starting song goes first |
| Turn | Song plays → active player places card on their timeline → card flips |
| Correct | Card stays on timeline |
| Incorrect | Card discarded |
| Same year | Placing before or after a card with the same year counts as correct |
| Challenge | Non-placing participants (not spectators) can challenge during 3s window after placement. Wrong placement → challenger steals card. Correct → challenger loses a token. |
| Unrevealed song | Only active player sees blurred album art; others hear audio without title/artist/year until flip. |
| Flip reveal | Result shown ~2s (`FLIP_REVEAL_DISPLAY_MS`); server delays next turn accordingly. |
| Spectator | Joining mid-round: watch only; plays next round; cannot challenge. |
| Game log | Server-maintained `activeRound.gameLog`; client renders; survives late join. |
| Leave room | Header **Leave** in lobby and during rounds (reloads to entry page). |
| Token: skip | Spend 1 to discard current card, draw new one |
| Token: buy | Spend 3 to place a card directly (before hearing song). Skip next turn. |
| Token: earn | Name song title + artist correctly = +1 token (max 5) |
| Win | First to 6 correct cards on timeline |
| Deck empty | Player/team with most cards wins. Tiebreaker: highest avg release year. |
| Disconnect | Skip turn after 15s timeout. Remove from rotation after 2 missed turns. |

Game modes (Original / Pro / Expert / Cooperative) are defined in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` Part 1.

## Working approach for this project

### Before implementing any feature
1. Read the relevant section of `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` to understand the expected behaviour.
2. Check `shared/types.ts` to see if the types you need already exist.
3. Follow the order in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: types → engine logic → test → socket event → client handler.

### When something is ambiguous
Stop and ask rather than guessing. Game logic bugs are hard to find later. A 30-second check is worth it.

### Testing multiplayer locally
Open 2–3 browser tabs at `localhost:5173`. Each tab acts as a separate player. Create a room in one tab, join it in the others.

### Commit discipline
Small, working commits. Each commit should leave the game in a playable state if possible. Use conventional commits:
```
feat: add HITSTER! challenge window
fix: correct turn order after team placement
chore: add shared types for token events
```

## What not to do

- Do not add a database or any persistent storage
- Do not add user accounts or login flows
- Do not stream audio from the server
- Do not put game logic in the client
- Do not use Spotify Authorization Code Flow or expose Spotify secrets to the client
- Do not add features not in REQUIREMENTS.md without confirming first
- Do not use `any` in TypeScript — define the proper type in `shared/types.ts`

## Part 1 — Functional Requirements

_What the system does from a player's perspective. No technical detail._

---

### 1.1 Player Onboarding
- A player opens the game URL and enters their **email address** (required) and optionally a **display name**.
- The **display name** is shown to other players. If omitted, the local part of the email address is used as the fallback display name (e.g. `alex` from `alex@example.com`).
- Email is used to identify a player across reconnects and sessions. It is **never shown to other players**.
- After completing the form, the player can either:
  - **Create a room** (becoming the room owner), or
  - **Join a room** by entering a 4-character room code, or
  - **Click directly into an existing room** shown in the room browser (see §1.1.1).
- If the page is loaded with a `?room=XXXX` query parameter (e.g. from a shared invite link), the join form should be pre-filled with that code automatically. _(not yet implemented)_

#### 1.1.1 Room Browser
- The entry page displays a live list of all **active rooms** on the server (lobby or in-progress).
- Each room card shows:
  - **Room code** and **topic / description** set by the owner
  - **Genre / playlist** (e.g. "90s Night", "Pop Classics") — the song source label
  - **Participants**: player count and leader name
  - **Round status**: lobby waiting, or current round number
  - **Progress**: for in-progress rounds, the leading player/team's card count and the target (e.g. "Mike — 4 / 6 cards")
- Clicking a room card pre-fills the join code. The player still needs to have entered a valid email before joining.
- Rooms in **LOBBY** state can be joined freely.
- Rooms in **ROUND_ACTIVE** state can be joined as a **spectator**: watch the active timeline and game log, but no placement, tokens, or challenges until the next round.
- Rooms in **GAME_OVER** state are shown greyed-out and cannot be joined.
- The room list auto-refreshes every **2 seconds**.

### 1.2 Rooms
- Each room has a unique **room code** and a shareable **invite link** (copies `?room=XXXX` URL to clipboard from the lobby).
- The owner sets a **topic / description** for the room (e.g. "90s Night", "Office Party").
- Multiple game rounds can be played within the same room without players having to rejoin.
- Players can join a room at any point while it is in the **lobby** state (before a round starts).
- Only the room owner can configure rounds and start the game.
- Maximum **12 players** or **6 teams** per room.
- When **every participant is offline** (no open Socket.io connection), the room is removed from the server after a short grace period (~60s; 5s in test mode), including mid-round and game-over rooms.

### 1.3 Teams
- Any player in the lobby can create a team and invite others to join.
- Teams share a single timeline and token pool during a round.
- If no teams are created, each player has their own individual timeline.
- Players can join/leave teams between rounds. Teams carry over unless changed.
- A round in team mode requires at least 2 teams, each with at least 1 player.

### 1.4 Round Configuration
Before each round, the room owner sets:

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Song source | Spotify playlist URL or genre/theme | — |
| Game mode | Original / Pro / Expert / Cooperative | Original |
| Tokens enabled | Yes / No | Yes |
| Cards needed to win | 1–6 | 6 |

### 1.5 Gameplay — Hitster Rules (Digital)

#### Setup
- Each player/team receives **1 starting card** face-up (showing title, artist, and release year). This is the anchor of their timeline.
- The player/team with the **oldest starting song** takes the first turn.
- Starting token counts depend on game mode (see Game Modes table below).

#### Turn Structure
Each turn has three phases:

**REVEAL** — A new card is drawn from the deck and the song starts playing for all players simultaneously (synchronised via a server-issued `playAt` timestamp). No player sees the song's title, artist, or year until the card is flipped after placement; only the active player sees blurred album art while placing.

**PLACE** — The placing player selects a position on their timeline. The card is placed face-down. A **3-second challenge window** then opens for non-placing participants (not spectators).

**FLIP** — The card is revealed with a short animation; the correct/wrong result stays visible for **2 seconds** before the next turn starts. Placement is correct if the release year fits chronologically between its neighbours (same year as a neighbour also counts as correct). If correct, the card stays on the timeline. If incorrect, the card is discarded.

#### Token Mechanics

| Action | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Skip card** (your turn) | Spend 1 token to discard the current card and draw a new one. |
| **Challenge** | During the challenge window, any non-placing **participant** (not a spectator) can challenge via the **Challenge** button under the placed card. If the opponent placed incorrectly, challenger steals the card. If the opponent was correct, the challenger loses a token. |
| **Buy a card** | Spend 3 tokens to place a card on your timeline without hearing the song. Your next turn is auto-skipped. |
| **Earn a token** | Name the song title AND artist correctly during your turn = +1 token (max 5). Original/Cooperative only. |

#### Game Modes

| Mode | Rule | Starting Tokens |
|---|---|---|
| **Original** | Standard rules. Naming song earns +1 token. | 2 |
| **Pro** | Placing player must correctly name title + artist during the challenge window for the card to count. No naming token bonus. | 5 |
| **Expert** | Placing player must correctly name title, artist, and exact release year for the card to count. No naming token bonus. | 3 |
| **Cooperative** | All players share one timeline and one token pool. Incorrect placement costs 1 shared token. Win by reaching the card target; lose if tokens hit 0. No challenges. | 5 (shared) |

#### Winning
- **Individual / team**: First to correctly place the target number of cards on their timeline wins the round.
- **Cooperative**: Reach the card target before the shared token pool runs out.
- **Deck empty**: Player/team with the most cards wins. Tiebreaker: highest average release year.

### 1.6 Multiple Rounds
- After a round ends, the room returns to **lobby** state. The owner can start a new round with new or identical settings.
- Round history (winner, mode, round number) is shown on the end-of-round screen.
- Teams and player assignments carry over unless changed before the next round.

### 1.7 Known Limitations (v1)
- Spotify playlist URLs must be **public** playlists.
- Tracks with no 30-second audio preview (`preview_url = null`) are excluded from the deck automatically. The count is logged server-side; a future version may surface this in the lobby UI.
- If the deck runs out of cards before anyone wins, the tiebreaker rule (most cards, then highest avg year) applies.

---

## Part 2 — Technical Requirements

---

### 2.1 Real-Time Multiplayer
- All players in a room see game state changes in real time via Socket.io.
- Latency for game state updates should be imperceptible during normal play (<200ms).

### 2.2 Audio Synchronisation
- The server sends `previewUrl` + `playAt` (Unix ms, ~600ms in the future) to all clients simultaneously.
- Each client schedules `<audio>.play()` via `setTimeout` to fire at exactly `playAt`.
- Acceptable sync variance: ≤500ms between clients.

### 2.3 Spotify Integration
- Server authenticates with Spotify via **Client Credentials Flow** (no user login).
- Given a playlist URL or genre label, server retrieves tracks including title, artist(s), release year, album art URL, and `preview_url`.
- Tracks with `preview_url = null` are excluded from the deck; a warning is logged server-side with the count.

### 2.4 Audio Playback
- The `preview_url` is a publicly accessible 30-second MP3 on Spotify's CDN.
- Client plays it directly in a `<audio>` element. No server-side audio streaming.

### 2.5 Game State
- All game state is server-side and broadcast via WebSocket. Clients are stateless renderers.

### 2.6 No Authentication
- Players are identified by email + session ID (UUID in `sessionStorage`).
- Display name is the player's chosen name, or the email local part if omitted.
- Room ownership is tied to the creator's session ID.

```

### 3.2 Data Flow — Turn Lifecycle

1. Server draws next card, resolves `previewUrl` / `streamUrl`
2. Server emits `turn:started` → `{ activePlayerId, card: CardHidden, previewUrl, playAt, timelineLength, turnEndsAt }`
3. Active player: audio plays, timeline interactive, song identity hidden (blurred album art only)
4. Other participants: audio only until flip; **Challenge** under placed card during challenge window (watch timeline UI)
5. Spectators: watch active timeline + server game log; cannot challenge
6. Active player confirms position → `turn:placed` → challenge window (`CHALLENGE_WINDOW_MS`, 3s)
7. Timer expires → `turn:flipped` → inline reveal (~2s) → server waits `FLIP_REVEAL_DISPLAY_MS` → next turn
8. In Pro/Expert: card only lands on timeline if placing player named correctly (`currentTurn.named === true`)
9. Win check → `round:ended` or advance to next turn

### 3.3 Room State Machine

```
LOBBY → ROUND_ACTIVE → ROUND_ENDED → LOBBY (next round)
              │
              └── room:end (owner) → GAME_OVER
```

### 3.4 Resolved Design Decisions

| # | Decision | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Turn structure | Each player places on their own timeline on their turn. |
| 2 | Team placement | Any team member can place; first click confirms. |
| 3 | Challenge window | 3 seconds after placement (`CHALLENGE_WINDOW_MS`). |
| 8 | Unrevealed track privacy | Only the active player sees blurred album art; others hear audio without title/artist/year until flip. |
| 9 | Flip reveal pacing | Client shows result for 2s (`FLIP_REVEAL_DISPLAY_MS`); server delays next turn by the same interval. |
| 10 | Spectators | Mid-round joiners are spectators until the next round; no challenge UI. |
| 11 | Server game log | `activeRound.gameLog` appended on server; clients render for all (including late joiners). |
| 12 | Empty room cleanup | Delete room when all participants offline (~60s grace; 5s in test mode). |
| 4 | Deck exhaustion | Most cards wins; tiebreaker = highest avg release year. |
| 5 | Player disconnection | 15s auto-skip; removed from turn order after 2 consecutive missed turns. Disconnected players show an offline badge. |
| 6 | Room size | Max 12 players or 6 teams. |
| 7 | Poll interval | Room browser refreshes every 2s. |

## Part 4 — Technology Stack

### 4.1 Stack Overview

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Drag & drop | @dnd-kit/core |
| Real-time | Socket.io v4 |
| Backend | Node.js + TypeScript, Express |
| External API | Spotify Web API (Client Credentials Flow) |
| State | In-memory only — no database |
| Hosting | Fly.io (primary); Railway optional |

### 4.2 Repo Structure

```

├── server/src/
│   ├── index.ts          # Express + Socket.io entry point
│   ├── game/             # Pure game logic (engine.ts + tests)

└── .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### 4.3 CI Pipeline

| Job | Steps |
|---|---|
| **server** | `npm ci` (root) → TypeScript build → Jest (125 tests) |
| **client** | `npm ci` (root) → Vite build |
| **e2e** | Depends on server+client → Playwright with TEST_MODE server |

---

## Part 5 — Deployment

### 5.1 Platform
**Fly.io** — one always-on Machine (in-memory state), WebSockets, Docker deploy. See `docs/DEPLOY_FLY.md`. Railway (`railway.toml`) remains supported as an alternative.

### 5.2 Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Spotify app client ID |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Spotify app client secret |
| `PORT` | Server port (default: 3000) |
| `CLIENT_URL` | Allowed CORS origin (default: `http://localhost:5173`) |

### 5.3 TEST_MODE
`TEST_MODE=true` shortens timeouts (challenge window 500ms, flip reveal 300ms, empty-room TTL 5s, disconnect skip 3s) and enables mock Spotify tracks so tests run without real credentials.

---

## Part 6 — Testing

### 6.1 Unit Tests
Jest, 125 tests in `engine.test.ts`, `store.test.ts`, `client.test.ts`.
Run: `npm test` from root or `server/`.

Coverage: placement validation, token accounting (all modes), challenge resolution, win/loss detection, cooperative token depletion, Pro/Expert naming enforcement, max room size, disconnect handling, deck exhaustion tiebreak.

### 6.2 E2E Tests
Playwright, `e2e/tests/room-scenarios.spec.ts`. Runs against a live TEST_MODE server.
Run: `npx playwright test` from root.

### 6.3 Bot Players
`/bots/` — profile-driven Socket.io clients. Used for demo and manual testing.
Run: `npm start` from `bots/` or `npm run test:bots` from root.
CLI flags: `--room XXXX`, `--count N`, `--mode <mode>`, `--genre <label>`.
